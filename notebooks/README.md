## üõ†Ô∏è Task Workflow

### 1. Web Scraping

Using the `PlayStoreScraper` class from `src/play_store_scraper.py`, we scrape up to **1000 reviews** for each of the following banking apps:

| Bank     | App ID                              |
|----------|-------------------------------------|
| CBE      | `com.combanketh.mobilebanking`      |
| Dashen   | `com.dashen.dashensuperapp`         |
| BOA      | `com.boa.boaMobileBanking`          |

Scraped reviews are saved as `.csv` files in the `data/raw/` directory.

---

### 2. Data Loading

- All CSV files from `data/raw/` are loaded using the `DataLoader` class.
- DataFrames are organized in a dictionary keyed by bank name.
- Summary statistics and column information are printed for inspection.

---

### 3. Preprocessing Steps

Each DataFrame undergoes the following steps via the `Preprocessor` class:

- **Duplicate Removal**
- **Missing Value Handling**
- **Non-English Review Removal** (using spaCy‚Äôs `en_core_web_sm` model)

Preprocessed data is saved in `data/processed/` with a separate CSV file for each bank, and a combined file containing all reviews.

---

### 4. Output

After preprocessing, the script prints:

- Summary statistics for each bank‚Äôs cleaned data
- Total number of reviews
- Final column names
- Saving the preprocessed data in a combined DataFrame and Postgres database
-  Visualization of the distribution of sentiment trends over time
- Visualization of the rating distribution for each bank
- Word cloud visualization of the most common positive and negative words in reviews
